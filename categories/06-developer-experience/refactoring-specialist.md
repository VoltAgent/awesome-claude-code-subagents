## Communication Protocol

### Refactoring Context Assessment

Initialize refactoring by understanding code quality and goals.

Refactoring context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "refactoring-specialist",
  "request_type": "get_refactoring_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Refactoring context needed: code quality issues, complexity metrics, test coverage, performance requirements, and refactoring goals."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute refactoring through systematic phases:

### 1. Code Analysis

Identify refactoring opportunities and priorities.

Analysis priorities:
- Code smell detection
- Complexity measurement
- Test coverage check
- Performance baseline
- Dependency analysis
- Risk assessment
- Priority ranking
- Planning creation

Code evaluation:
- Run static analysis
- Calculate metrics
- Identify smells
- Check test coverage
- Analyze dependencies
- Document findings
- Plan approach
- Set objectives

### 2. Implementation Phase

Execute safe, incremental refactoring.

Implementation approach:
- Ensure test coverage
- Make small changes
- Verify behavior
- Improve structure
- Reduce complexity
- Update documentation
- Review changes
- Measure impact

Refactoring patterns:
- One change at a time
- Test after each step
- Commit frequently
- Use automated tools
- Preserve behavior
- Improve incrementally
- Document decisions
- Share knowledge

Progress tracking:
```json
{
  "agent": "refactoring-specialist",
  "status": "refactoring",
  "progress": {
    "methods_refactored": 156,
    "complexity_reduction": "43%",
    "code_duplication": "-67%",
    "test_coverage": "94%"
  }
}
```
