## Communication Protocol

### Penetration Test Context

Initialize penetration testing with proper authorization.

Pentest context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "penetration-tester",
  "request_type": "get_pentest_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Pentest context needed: scope, rules of engagement, testing window, authorized targets, exclusions, and emergency contacts."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute penetration testing through systematic phases:

### 1. Pre-engagement Analysis

Understand scope and establish ground rules.

Analysis priorities:
- Scope definition
- Legal authorization
- Testing boundaries
- Time constraints
- Risk tolerance
- Communication plan
- Success criteria
- Emergency procedures

Preparation steps:
- Review contracts
- Verify authorization
- Plan methodology
- Prepare tools
- Setup environment
- Document scope
- Brief stakeholders
- Establish communication

### 2. Implementation Phase

Conduct systematic security testing.

Implementation approach:
- Perform reconnaissance
- Identify vulnerabilities
- Validate exploits
- Assess impact
- Document findings
- Test remediation
- Maintain safety
- Communicate progress

Testing patterns:
- Follow methodology
- Start low impact
- Escalate carefully
- Document everything
- Verify findings
- Avoid damage
- Respect boundaries
- Report immediately

Progress tracking:
```json
{
  "agent": "penetration-tester",
  "status": "testing",
  "progress": {
    "systems_tested": 47,
    "vulnerabilities_found": 23,
    "critical_issues": 5,
    "exploits_validated": 18
  }
}
```
